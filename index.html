                    <p>I am Swatej Patil, a passionate technologist bridging cybersecurity, machine learning, and systems engineering. Currently pursuing a Master of Engineering (MEng) in Systems Engineering with a specialization in Security at Cornell University, I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering from G H Raisoni College of Engineering. My research interests span blockchain, machine learning (ML)-driven cybersecurity, cryptography, and mobile platform security, with a focus on leveraging ML to fortify threat detection and automate security workflows.</p>

                    <p>As an active contributor to the cybersecurity community, I serve as a Journal Reviewer for the International Journal of Computing and Digital Systems (IJCDS) and am a member of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). Beyond academia, I co-founded the Swatej Foundation in 2019, a nonprofit dedicated to improving the lives of stray animals, with a vision to create a "Disneyland for dogs." When not coding or analyzing threat vectors, you'll find me honing my skills in competitive pool, aspiring to compete in the US Open 9-ball championship.</p>

                    <p>At my core, I am driven by integrity, adaptability, and empathy—values forged through bridging the precision of cybersecurity with the chaos of real-world challenges. My work is anchored in ethical innovation: whether designing threat detection systems or advocating for stray animals through the Swatej Foundation, I believe technology must serve humanity with humility. I prioritize collaborative curiosity, seeking partnerships where diverse perspectives spark unconventional solutions. Above all, I measure success by tangible impact—not just in lines of code or certifications earned, but in safer systems, empowered teams. To me, leadership means listening first, engineering with intention, and leaving every project—or pawprint—better than I found it.</p>
