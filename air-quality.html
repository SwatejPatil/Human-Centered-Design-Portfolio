                    <h3>Indoor Air Quality: The Hidden Threat in Our Homes</h3>
                    <div class="pitch-content">
                        <p>Most people think of smog and traffic when they hear the word 'pollution' — but the real danger might be inside your home. In places like New Delhi, people spend 90% of their time indoors, yet air quality indoors is often 2 to 5 times worse than outside.</p>
                        
                        <p>Adams County shares many of the same behaviors and risks — incense burning, poor ventilation, and low awareness about the air we breathe inside. If we don't act now, we're ignoring a silent threat impacting our children's health and our community's future.</p>

                    <h3>A Mission to Improve Indoor Air Quality in Adams County</h3>
                    <p>Adams County, Colorado is increasingly facing a silent yet serious public health challenge: poor indoor air quality. While Colorado is often associated with clean mountain air, areas within Adams County, especially urban and industrial zones, can experience elevated levels of indoor pollutants. According to data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), indoor air can be two to five times more polluted than outdoor air, due to factors like inadequate ventilation, building materials, and household products — all in the very spaces where people spend over 90% of their time.</p>
                    
                    <p>This project explores innovative approaches to improve indoor air quality in Adams County — through self-sustaining air purifiers, solar-powered systems, or smart ventilation technologies. To ensure our efforts reflect real community concerns, I've conducted a survey of ten residents from various neighborhoods in the county, capturing their lived experiences, challenges, and expectations regarding indoor air.</p>
                    
                    <p class="highlight-text">Together, let's co-create solutions that are clean, sustainable, and inclusive — because clean indoor air is a necessity, not a privilege.</p>

                <div class="methodology-content">
                    <h4>Explanation of Sampling Choice</h4>
                    <p>Due to the scope and time constraints of this project, I was unable to identify or contact individuals specifically from Adams County, Colorado, who were available to participate in the survey. As an alternative, I collected responses from ten residents of New Delhi, India, a city with some of the worst air quality levels globally. While the demographics and environmental context differ from Adams County, the core themes of the survey — indoor air quality (IAQ), individual behavior, and perceptions — are still relevant. These responses serve as a valuable baseline for understanding how people interact with and perceive indoor air pollution in highly affected environments. The survey format, questions, and response trends can later be adapted and administered in Adams County for future iterations of the project.</p>

                    <h4>Survey Design Details</h4>
                    <div class="survey-details">
                        <p><strong>Questions:</strong> The survey consisted of 17 questions covering demographics, home environment factors, indoor pollutant sources, personal habits, awareness, and willingness to invest in air quality improvements. These were designed based on established environmental health survey templates and adapted for relevance to indoor air pollution.</p>

                        <p><strong>Creation:</strong> I drafted the survey after reviewing studies from the WHO, EPA, and peer-reviewed literature on common indoor air quality risk factors. The goal was to cover behavioral, structural, and perceptual elements of IAQ in a concise and accessible format.</p>

                        <p><strong>Participants:</strong> Due to limited access to contacts in Adams County, I administered the survey to ten individuals living in various parts of New Delhi. These participants represented a range of ages, household sizes, income levels, and occupations.</p>

                        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose was to understand people's day-to-day exposure to indoor air pollutants, their awareness of health risks, and their willingness to adopt cleaner technologies or habits. These insights are foundational to designing interventions that are both user-informed and contextually realistic.</p>

                        <p class="context-text">I initially intended to collect survey data from residents of Adams County, Colorado, the primary focus area of this project. However, due to personal constraints and lack of existing local contacts, I was unable to reach a sufficient number of participants. Instead, I turned to respondents from New Delhi, which, while geographically different, offers important parallels: both regions include residential, industrial, and semi-urban zones, and IAQ is a growing concern in each.</p>
                        <p class="context-text">The insights below are based on a structured survey of 10 individuals from New Delhi, used here as a proxy population. The questions focused on behaviors, beliefs, motivations, and willingness to invest in IAQ improvements.</p>

                                <p>Did you know the air inside your home can be more polluted than the air outside? In Adams County, common habits like burning incense, using strong cleaning sprays, or leaving kitchen areas unventilated are silently affecting our lungs—especially those of children and seniors.</p>
                                
                                <p>But here's the good news: small changes can lead to big improvements in your indoor air quality. Opening your windows daily, switching to low-emission cleaning products, using exhaust fans while cooking, and investing in a portable air purifier (or even a few indoor plants) can make your home healthier.</p>
                                
                                <p>We're launching the Clean Home Air Challenge to help residents like you take these small, affordable steps. Visit our site to learn more, get air-friendly product discounts, and hear from neighbors who've already made changes.</p>
                                
                                <p>Let's make breathing at home feel as safe as it should.</p>

                                <p>In the growing conversation about air pollution, we often overlook where we spend most of our time: indoors. For residents in Adams County, especially low-income families in aging housing, indoor air can be 2 to 5 times more polluted than the air outside.</p>
                                
                                <p>This pollution comes from seemingly harmless sources—cooking without exhaust, mold buildup, harsh cleaning products, or poorly ventilated rooms. Yet it directly correlates with rising asthma rates, chronic respiratory conditions, and long-term healthcare burdens.</p>
                                
                                <p>Our proposal is simple: initiate a city-wide awareness and support campaign that educates residents about low-cost indoor air fixes, subsidizes air purifiers for at-risk populations, and adds indoor air quality criteria to new housing development guidelines.</p>
                                
                                <p>Improving indoor air isn't just a private concern—it's a public health imperative. With modest investment, Adams County can become a model for healthier homes and proactive governance.</p>

                                <p>Incense sticks, open kitchens, dust from mattresses, and lack of ventilation all add up to toxic air that your kids breathe 24/7. But with just a few easy steps, you can change that:</p>
                                
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Open your windows every morning for 20 minutes</li>
                                    <li>Use an exhaust fan or chimney while cooking</li>
                                    <li>Keep your floors and bedding clean with a wet mop</li>
                                    <li>Add air-cleaning plants like snake plant or money plant</li>
                                    <li>Avoid aerosol sprays and use natural cleaners instead</li>

                                <p>Indoor air pollution in Indian cities is an invisible yet critical public health concern. In urban homes across New Delhi, high indoor particulate levels—due to cooking emissions, poor ventilation, and synthetic building materials—are contributing to respiratory illnesses, especially in children and the elderly.</p>
                                
                                <p>We urge the Ministry to include Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) metrics in existing Smart Cities and affordable housing initiatives by:</p>
                                
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Offering tax credits or subsidies for air filtration systems in new housing</li>
                                    <li>Mandating mechanical ventilation standards for multi-story developments</li>
                                    <li>Supporting pilot projects on self-sufficient air-cleaning technologies</li>
                                    <li>Funding public education campaigns for behavioral change at the household level</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>Addressing IAQ proactively aligns with India's long-term health, climate, and development goals. We welcome the opportunity to collaborate further on this essential mission.</p>

                <div class="prototype-overview">
                    <p>To address indoor air quality challenges in both New Delhi (India) and Adams County (USA), I developed and tested three prototypes. These interventions were designed to be low-cost, accessible, and behavior-focused, aiming to improve awareness, motivate individual action, and reduce health risks caused by poor indoor air quality. Each prototype was chosen based on specific stakeholder insights, and each was tested to gather meaningful user feedback.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="prototype-item">
                    <h4>Prototype 1: Behavior-Change Infographic (New Delhi)</h4>
                    <div class="prototype-type">Design Goal: Encourage middle-class families in Delhi to adopt low-cost, everyday habits to improve air quality in homes.</div>
                    
                    <div class="prototype-details">
                        <p><strong>Prototype:</strong> A multilingual, visually engaging infographic explaining key actions (e.g., increasing ventilation, cleaning air-purifying plants, using kitchen exhaust fans, and avoiding incense or candles).</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Testing Approach:</strong> Shared digitally with 10 participants from my initial survey group via WhatsApp and Instagram. They were asked to try 2–3 suggested habits over the course of 3–5 days.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Results:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most participants responded positively to suggestions that were low effort (e.g., "open windows in morning," "wipe dust from fan blades").</li>
                            <li>Visual elements (such as red/yellow/green symbols for "air health") were more impactful than textual instructions.</li>
                            <li>Participants preferred tips that felt culturally relevant (e.g., placing tulsi/basil plants near windows).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Infographics with hyper-local messaging and clear visuals can drive small but effective behavior shifts. For scale, future versions can be printed in community centers or local clinics.</p>

                    <div class="prototype-details">
                        <p><strong>Prototype:</strong> A digital and printable "Indoor Air Journal" where users log daily behaviors (e.g., use of cleaners, windows open/closed, use of air filters) and symptoms (e.g., dry eyes, sneezing).</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Testing Approach:</strong> Distributed to 7 community members over 5 days. They were asked to complete a short log every evening.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Results:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Users found the act of logging helped them become more mindful about their behaviors.</li>
                            <li>Many began adjusting actions mid-week (e.g., stopped burning candles, increased window ventilation).</li>
                            <li>Participants reported a noticeable difference in symptoms when avoiding certain products or dust accumulation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Self-monitoring raised awareness and led to spontaneous behavior changes. This approach could be expanded into a mobile app with reminders and tailored air tips.</p>

                        <p><strong>Prototype:</strong> A do-it-yourself air filter using a basic box fan and MERV-13 filter (a well-established low-cost method for air cleaning).</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Testing Approach:</strong> Assembled and delivered to 3 households—2 in Adams County and 1 in Delhi. Families were asked to use it in their living space for 5 days and share qualitative feedback.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Results:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All households reported the DIY filter helped with visible dust reduction.</li>
                            <li>Participants appreciated that the kit was cheap, easy to assemble, and did not require installation.</li>
                            <li>Some users in Delhi were concerned about long-term electricity use, suggesting the need for more energy-efficient fan options.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The DIY air filter is an immediately actionable solution for areas with limited access to expensive purifiers. Partnering with NGOs or schools could help mass-produce or distribute these kits with guidance.</p>
